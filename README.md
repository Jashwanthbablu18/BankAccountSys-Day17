# 🏦 Day 17 - Bank Account System (OOP)

Welcome to **Day 17** of my **#30DaysOfPythonChallenge**!  
Today’s focus was on understanding and applying **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in Python.

---

## 📌 Topic
**OOP in Python** — Using `class`, `object`, `self`, and `__init__()` to build real-world applications.

---

## 🧠 What I Built

A CLI-based **Bank Account System** that allows users to:
- ✅ Create a new bank account with an initial balance
- 💰 Deposit money into the account
- 🧾 Withdraw money with a balance check
- 👀 View the current balance anytime

---

## 🧰 Concepts Used

- `class` and `object` for modeling real-world entities
- `__init__()` for constructor logic
- `self` for referencing object properties
- Instance methods to define behaviors (`deposit()`, `withdraw()`, `display_balance()`)
- Encapsulation to keep data and behavior together

## 💻 How to Run

```bash
python Day-17Code.py
